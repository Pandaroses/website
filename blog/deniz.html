<div class=""> <p>The up and coming football star <strong>Baby Gronk</strong> has been announced dead in the ambulance after a 2 ton peterbilt truck trailer ran over him while he was attempting to cross the texas 5 laner.
While his parents and loved ones, notably <a href="https://google.com/search?q=livvy%20dunne">Livvy Dunned</a> is in grief upon finding out about this information.
However, this event might not be fully negative, as it means the average noob now also has a chance to rizz up livvy dunne.
Livvy has announced she will host a rizz party in loving memory of her dear rizzler, and she primarily plans to have skibidi music playing.
An interview with the owner of the peterbilt 2 ton truck trailer after the event has shown that he feels no remorse, in fact he was fully aware and ran over the short-heighted baby gronk on purpose.
He said that his son will enjoy the rizz party and might end up rizzing some high level gyatts during the event.</p>
